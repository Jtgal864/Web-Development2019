What is CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

- Cascading refers to the way CSS applies one style on top of another.
- Style Sheets control the look and feel of web documents.

CSS and HTML work hand in hand:
- HTML sorts out the page structure.
- CSS defines how HTML elements are displayed.


Why Use CSS?
CSS allows you to apply specific styles to specific HTML elements.

The main benefit of CSS is that it allows you to separate style from content.

Using just HTML, all the styles and formatting are in the same place, which becomes rather difficult to maintain as the page grows.


Inline CSS
Using an inline style is one of the ways to insert a style sheet. With an inline style, a unique style is applied to a single element.

In order to use an inline style, add the style attribute to the relevant tag.


Embedded/Internal CSS
Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the head section of an HTML page.


External CSS
With this method, all styling rules are contained in a single text file, which is saved with the .css extension.

This CSS file is then referenced in the HTML using the <link> tag. The <link> element goes inside the head section.



CSS Syntax
CSS is composed of style rules that the browser interprets and then applies to the corresponding elements in your document.
A style rule has three parts: selector, property, and value.



Type Selectors
The most common and easy to understand selectors are type selectors. This selector targets element types on the page.



id and class Selectors
id selectors allow you to style an HTML element that has an id attribute, regardless of their position in the document tree. Here is an example of an id selector:

The HTML:
<div id="intro">
   <p> This paragraph is in the intro section.</p>
</div>
<p> This paragraph is not in the intro section.</p>

The CSS:
#intro {
   color: white;
   background-color: gray;
}



Descendant Selectors
These selectors are used to select elements that are descendants of another element. When selecting levels, you can select as many levels deep as you need to.

For example, to target only <em> elements in the first paragraph of the "intro" section:

The HTML:
<div id="intro">
   <p class="first">This is a <em> paragraph.</em></p>
   <p> This is the second paragraph. </p>
</div>
<p class="first"> This is not in the intro section.</p>
<p> The second paragraph is not in the intro section. </p>

The CSS:
#intro .first em {
   color: pink; 
   background-color:gray;
}



Comments
Comments are used to explain your code, and may help you when you edit the source code later. Comments are ignored by browsers.

A CSS comment look like this:
/* Comment goes here */

Example:
p { 
  color: green; 
  /* This is a comment */
  font-size: 150%;
}



Cascade
The final appearance of a web page is a result of different styling rules.

The three main sources of style information that form a cascade are:

- The stylesheet created by the author of the page
- The browser's default styles
- Styles specified by the user



Inheritance
Inheritance refers to the way properties flow through the page. A child element will usually take on the characteristics of the parent element unless otherwise defined.

For example:
<html>
   <head>
      <style>
      body {
         color: green;
         font-family: Arial;
      }
     </style>
   </head>
   <body>       
      <p>
      This is a text inside the paragraph. 
      </p>
   </body>
</html>
